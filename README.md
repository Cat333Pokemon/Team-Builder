# Team Builder by Cat
Pokémon Gen 5 team builder from late 2012/early 2013

This program is designed to assist competitive battlers interested in creating teams and analyzing their usefulness. Using data from the veekun Pokédex project, I've compiled a simplified database of essential Black & White 2 data to help create the perfect team.

## Features

- Stat calculation, which takes into account IVs, EVs, and nature
- List of all weaknesses and resistances of each Pokémon (including multipliers on mouse hover), and a total analysis of global weaknesses and resistances to find possible holes in teams
- Selection of any move or held item
- Six Pokémon tabs, one for each team member, and an analysis tab
- Saving/loading teams
- Saving/loading individual Pokémon
- Exporting of an HTML or CSV file for usage in other programs, or as text for posting on forums
- Team printing for battlers on the go or those who want a hard copy
- Multiple windows can be open at the same time to work on multiple teams at once
- Built in FAQ

## System requirements

- Windows 8, 7, Server 2008, Vista, Server 2003, XP
- 3 MB disk space
- 256 MB RAM
- 1024x600 minimum desktop resolution
- The dependencies listed below

## Dependencies

These programs are required to run the Team Builder:

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4
- Microsoft SQL Server Compact 3.5
   - 32-bit users, install the 32-bit version
   - 64-bit users, install both the 32-bit version and the 64-bit version

## Getting started

1. Download and install the two dependencies listed above. These programs may already be installed, especially .NET Framework 4, which is delivered through Windows Update.
2. Download the ZIP archive from [Releases](https://github.com/Cat333Pokemon/Team-Builder/releases).
3. Extract the two files to the same folder. The database is required for the program to function and is the reason Microsoft SQL Server Compact is required.
4. Run the program. If it fails, return to step 1. If it still refuses to start, post a reply to this thread with your issue.
